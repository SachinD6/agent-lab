# agent-lab

Welcome to your new [Mastra](https://mastra.ai) project! We're excited to see what you build.

This starter provides you with a general-purpose Mastra agent that can research current information, manage multi-step tasks, work with local files, run approved shell commands, and create recurring schedules.

## Features

- A local `workspace/` for files and command execution (created under `src/mastra/public/workspace/` when running `mastra dev`)
- Approval gates for file changes, deletions, and shell commands
- Conversation memory, generated thread titles, and task tracking
- Direct web page fetching (`web_search` is disabled: Google Search grounding returns 429 on this API key)
- GitHub repository search via the GitHub REST API
- Recurring schedules that persist across restarts
- Local libSQL storage and DuckDB observability, with optional Turso storage
- A bundled Mastra skill that helps coding agents use current Mastra APIs

## Get started

Set your `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` in `.env` or in your environment, then run:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4111](http://localhost:4111) in your browser to access [Mastra Studio](https://mastra.ai/docs/studio/overview).

Select **Agent** in Mastra Studio and try one of these prompts:

- `Create a landing page for a Japanese sakura festival.`
- `What files are in your workspace?`

The agent asks for approval before it changes files or runs commands. When it creates a schedule, it returns an ID that you can use to pause the schedule.

## Trace server

The Go server in `server/` accepts `POST /traces` on port `8090`, prints each request body, and appends it as one JSON line to `server/traces.json`. The agent posts one trace record after every run; if the server is down, the run still completes.

```shell
cd server && go run .
```

## Workspace safety

The local filesystem tools stay inside the `workspace/` directory, which resolves relative to the server's working directory (`src/mastra/public/workspace/` during `mastra dev`). Shell commands start in that directory, but `LocalSandbox` does not provide operating-system isolation by default. Review command approvals carefully, and do not expose this template through an unauthenticated public server.

## Storage

The default `file:./mastra.db` database stores agent memory, tasks, and schedules locally. To use Turso, set `TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` in `.env`.

Recurring schedules continue to use model tokens until you pause them. Ask the agent to pause a schedule with the ID returned by `start_schedule`.

## Making it yours

- Edit `src/mastra/agents/agent.ts` to change the model, instructions, memory, workspace, or approval policy.
- Edit `src/mastra/tools/` to customize scheduling.
- Edit `src/mastra/index.ts` to change storage and observability.
- Add files or reusable skills under `src/mastra/public/workspace/` for the agent to use during `mastra dev`.
